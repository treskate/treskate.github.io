A new photo of Luis with a <a href="images/photos/skate/luiskf-doubleset.jpg">kickflip</a> at the Spring Skatepark. Also two new iPhone photos. One of Moe with a <a href="images/photos/iphone/moewallride.jpg">wallride</a> at a sketchy spot and one of Eddie with a <a href="images/photos/iphone/polejam.jpg">pole jam</a> from last weekend. You can watch the video clip of the pole jam <a href="http://instagram.com/p/uXDwLEDHtr/?modal=trueg">here</a>.

I haven't updated in a while because my iMac died a few months ago. No computer means no updates. I did upload some random videos that can be found <a href="http://treskate.net/post/40795581058/ss-clips" target="out"><u>here</u></a> and <a href="http://treskate.net/post/39781197878/thatsawrap" target="out"><u>here</u></a>. More videos coming soon...don't you hate when people say that? I know I do.

I updated all the videos pages to look the same. They aren't completely done though. I also uploaded this old <a href="http://treskate.net/post/26222511280/3g-clip" target="out"><u>video</u></a> of myself on my blog.

I finally uploaded the <a href="othervideos.html">other</a> videos page. I had no idea it was down this whole time. Right now it's not perfect, but at least the page is up. I also updated the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page while I was at it. More updates coming soon...

I've updated the photos page. There is now a link for the iPhone pictures. Yup, that's right. Two updates in one day! Well, kind of. Give me a break.

<p></p><b>Edit:</b> I also updated the <a href="prologue.html">Prologue</a> page. Now if you click the video thumbnails it will take you to the vimeo page for you can watch the videos in high quality. I didn't link the videos to youtube because they have disabled a lot of the music in the Prologue parts. Sucks, but there's nothing I can do about it.

Wow, it's been a year since I've last updated the site! That's crazy (and lazy). Well, there isn't much to report. My iMac died on me so I can't edit any montages for you guys. I still take pictures and record videos, but mostly on my iPhone. Expect a iPhone Clips #2 montage soon…and when I say "soon" hopefully that means with in the next 2-3 months. I'm still updating my <a href="http://treskate.net" target="out"><u>blog</u></a> with random skate clips and photos. I'm not sure who still comes here, but thanks for the support!
<p></p>
Oh, and I made a new photo section called <a href="http://treskate.com/iphone.html">iPhone</u></a>. It's a work in progress.

Yeah, I know I haven't updated this in a while. Big whoop, wanna fight about it? Anyway, I made a <a href="iphoneclips.html"><u>new montage</u></a> a few days ago. They are all clips I got with my iPhone 4. It's not really a serious montage, but I think it turned out decent enough.

I made another site. It has nothing to do with skateboarding though. The website is <a href="http://www.getcreepedout.com" target="out"><u>www.getcreepedout.com</u></a>. Of course don't forget to check out my <a href="http://www.treskate.net" target="out"><u>blog</u></a> also.

I know it's been a long time, but I finally redesigned the whole site. Some of you might not even notice though. It's about 75% done right now. I still need to upload a lot more photos and fix a few more things. This layout works a lot better with iPhones/iPods/iPads.
